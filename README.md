*** Movie database project ***
This project creates and keeps a movie database.
The movies added to the database are decided by the user.
The user can list the movies, add new movies, delete movies, update movies, get stats from the database - like the best movie, worst, get a random movie, search a movie, see the movies sorted by rating and generate a nice looking website with all the movies in the database.
